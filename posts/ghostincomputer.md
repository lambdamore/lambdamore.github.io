# 计算机里的精灵

这两天在重读《禅与摩托车维修艺术》，这次是垃圾堆旁捡到的英文版。读到第八页，又找到了那句话：

*“佛陀或是耶稣坐在电脑和变速齿轮旁修行，会像坐在莲花座和山顶上一样自在。如果不这么认为，那无异于亵渎了佛陀——也就是亵渎了你自己。”*

*The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits 
of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think 
otherwise is to demean the Buddha.. .which is to demean oneself.*

我很想把这句话分享给本科时候的一位启蒙恩师，他教我翻开第一本哲学原著，窥视真正的数学，告诉我最锋利的东西不是激光而是戴德金分割，警告我宇宙有多深遂，两性关系就有多复杂。虽然把他视作人生的教父，但是我们俩气质上有一些截然不同的地方，他有一种田园情结，这种情结里多少暗含着一些对技术的不信任，而我向往做一个cyber punk。

往深一点看，我的情结来自对力量的向往，因为我要设法谋生，而我老师的认识来自对人类滥用力量的担忧，毕竟他不需要为自己过多担忧。不论如何，我们进行讨论的语境依然是融洽的。语言这种东西，把它探究得太远迟早会崩塌(Paul Graham)，所以语境的搭建尤其重要，不幸的是我仍不断地碰到那些令人筋疲力竭的争论，两边一开始就不打算用同样的词语表述相似的东西。满地散落的卡片，搭不起一个精巧的纸牌屋。




你可以一直呆在一种低等的抽象阶段，这样你永远不会有更高层次的抽象，given the limitation of the hierarchy that human perform his thinking, you can not reach higher level understanding. let alone the higher level than higher abstraction, that is, to go back and forth between hierarchical models, to see what you have gained through abstraction and what you have lost through abstraction.

武侠小说 武功秘籍 深度训练。*听过很多道理，却依然过不好这一生。*废话，人生即使如此容易过，也会不让它好过。禅宗公案。肤浅。公案。读过的书并没有自然而然地教会我怎样活下去。这就像会推导Navier-Stokes方程组不表示理解大气环流一样。生活可以被视为某种哲学观的应用题，可以被视为柴米油盐，也可以被视为禅宗公案。可是生活便是生活，比喻是偷换概念。

Words break if you push them too far.

They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at too low a resolution.

Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to attract new readers. Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity in this respect. If you write in an unclear way about big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students. Till one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand. To someone who hasn't learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive: as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope. That was what lured me in as a high school student.

I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering off into a swamp of abstractions. Instead of trying to answer the question:
What are the most general truths?
let's try to answer the question
Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?

These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently.

You don't have to tell anyone you're doing philosophy.

Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500. There is a lot more to discover.


The definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.

Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in logic. I don't know if I learned anything from them. [1] It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a couple things changed. But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it? I don't know.

我起初并没有发现自己是一个愚钝的人。可以读完formal logic，但是当我看到它里面的一些点子真正被计算机应用的时候，我仍旧感到震惊，这种震惊有点让人不好意思，因为我已经看到过这种道理，但是我不理解它，还自以为已经理解了它，直到它被计算机展示出来。演绎能力不足。

There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy. The most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker. I learned that I don't exist. I am (and you are) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I. But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live. Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies. Imagine waking up after such an operation. You have to imagine being two people.

可能我不够天才，但更有可能是天才也不是一蹴而就，需要时间持续地思考，试错。可是有没有什么工具可以缩短这段时间呢？ 有的，人是需要被超越的东西。人是一座桥。


We’re not ruled by engineers, not yet, but they have become the dominant force in American life – the highest, most influential tier of our elite.

There’s another way to describe this historical progression. Automation has come in waves. During the industrial revolution, machinery replaced manual workers. At first, machines required human operators. Over time, machines came to function with hardly any human intervention. For centuries, engineers automated physical labour; our new engineering elite has automated thought. They have perfected technologies that take over intellectual processes, that render the brain redundant. Or, as the former Google and Yahoo executive Marissa Mayer once argued, “You have to make words less human and more a piece of the machine.”

they are supplying us with efficiency; they are imposing order on human life.


“You know, I’m an engineer, and I think a key part of the engineering mindset is this hope and this belief that you can take any system that’s out there and make it much, much better than it is today. Anything, whether it’s hardware or software, a company, a developer ecosystem – you can take anything and make it much, much better.” 

可是他也高楼的非人性。泥土。

如何应用哲学到生活中。我总是做不好。谁做得最好？

*“心智的活动，除了尽力产生各种简单的知识之外，主要表现在如下三个方面*

*1）将若干简单认识组合为一个复合认识，由此产生出各种复杂的认识。*

*2）将两个认识放在一起对照，不管它们如何简单或者复杂，在这样做时并不将它们合而为一。由此得到有关它们的相互关系的认识。*

*3）将有关认识与那些在实际中和它们同在的所有其他认识隔离开，这就是抽象，所有具有普遍性的认识都是这样得到的。”*

The problem is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organisations that run the machines.

we have a microscope that not only lets us examine social behaviour at a very fine level that we’ve never been able to see before, but allows us to run experiments that millions of users are exposed to. 

The whole effort is to make human beings predictable – to anticipate their behaviour, which makes them easier to manipulate.

什么是数据？“我们可以将数据定义为一组适当的选择函数和构造函数，以及使这些过程成为一套合法表示， In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation.

In Cowboy Bebop, for example, Watanabe blends classic cowboy western with 1960s/1970s New York City film noir, jazz/blues music, Hong Kong action movies, and sets the entire series in space. In his later work, Samurai Champloo, Watanabe unites the cultures of Okinawa, hip hop, modern-day Japan, and chanbara.

They believe the truth can be easily told but hardly followed. I think it's the opposite.

Couldn't you add something equivalent to Lisp macros to languages like Perl or Python?

Not without turning them into dialects of Lisp. Real macros need to operate on the parse tree of the program.

But it would be hard to do that without creating a notation for parse trees; and once you do, your language has become a skin on Lisp, in much the same way that in OS X, the Mac OS became a skin on Unix.
