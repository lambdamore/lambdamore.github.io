# 计算机里的精灵

这两天在重读《禅与摩托车维修艺术》，这次是英文版。读到第八页，又找到了那句话：

*“佛陀或是耶稣坐在电脑和变速齿轮旁修行，会像坐在莲花座和山顶上一样自在。如果不这么认为，那无异于亵渎了佛陀——也就是亵渎了你自己。”*

*The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits 
of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think 
otherwise is to demean the Buddha.. .which is to demean oneself.*


我很想把这句话分享给本科时候的一位启蒙恩师，他教我翻开第一本哲学原著，审视真正的数学，告诉我最锋利的东西不是激光而是戴德金分割。虽然把他视作人生的教父，但是我们俩气质上有一些截然不同的地方，他有一种田园情结，这种情节里多少暗含着一些对技术的不信任，而我是一个cyber punk。

这种区别，对“力量” 尼安德特人 智人。 我的夫人。 现代人。对技术天然的敌意。

听过很多道理，却依然过不好这一生。废话，人生即使如此容易过，也会不让它好过。禅宗公案。

读过的书并没有自然而然地教会我怎样活下去。这就像会推导Navier-Stokes方程组不表示理解大气环流一样。生活可以被视为某种哲学观的应用题，可以被视为柴米油盐，也可以被视为禅宗公案。可是生活便是生活，比喻是偷换概念。

We’re not ruled by engineers, not yet, but they have become the dominant force in American life – the highest, most influential tier of our elite.

There’s another way to describe this historical progression. Automation has come in waves. During the industrial revolution, machinery replaced manual workers. At first, machines required human operators. Over time, machines came to function with hardly any human intervention. For centuries, engineers automated physical labour; our new engineering elite has automated thought. They have perfected technologies that take over intellectual processes, that render the brain redundant. Or, as the former Google and Yahoo executive Marissa Mayer once argued, “You have to make words less human and more a piece of the machine.”

they are supplying us with efficiency; they are imposing order on human life.


“You know, I’m an engineer, and I think a key part of the engineering mindset is this hope and this belief that you can take any system that’s out there and make it much, much better than it is today. Anything, whether it’s hardware or software, a company, a developer ecosystem – you can take anything and make it much, much better.” 

可是他也高楼的非人性。泥土。

如何应用哲学到生活中。我总是做不好。谁做得最好？

*“心智的活动，除了尽力产生各种简单的知识之外，主要表现在如下三个方面*

*1）将若干简单认识组合为一个复合认识，由此产生出各种复杂的认识。*

*2）将两个认识放在一起对照，不管它们如何简单或者复杂，在这样做时并不将它们合而为一。由此得到有关它们的相互关系的认识。*

*3）将有关认识与那些在实际中和它们同在的所有其他认识隔离开，这就是抽象，所有具有普遍性的认识都是这样得到的。”*

If people are expected to behave well, they tend to

Lisp

The problem is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organisations that run the machines.

we have a microscope that not only lets us examine social behaviour at a very fine level that we’ve never been able to see before, but allows us to run experiments that millions of users are exposed to. 

The whole effort is to make human beings predictable – to anticipate their behaviour, which makes them easier to manipulate.

In Cowboy Bebop, for example, Watanabe blends classic cowboy western with 1960s/1970s New York City film noir, jazz/blues music, Hong Kong action movies, and sets the entire series in space. In his later work, Samurai Champloo, Watanabe unites the cultures of Okinawa, hip hop, modern-day Japan, and chanbara.

(from conceptual to "reality") to form understandings

learn clean Python 

why I don't think Python is a good first language? 某年寒假。我没有需求。即使我有需求，用它做完了之后，也只会取得和当年用c语言硬生生拼出一个遗传算法一样的精疲力竭。

see it as a soap bubble?

They believe the truth can be easily told but hardly followed. I think it's the opposite.

"The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it."

– Paul Kedrosky

Couldn't you add something equivalent to Lisp macros to languages like Perl or Python?

Not without turning them into dialects of Lisp. Real macros need to operate on the parse tree of the program.

But it would be hard to do that without creating a notation for parse trees; and once you do, your language has become a skin on Lisp, in much the same way that in OS X, the Mac OS became a skin on Unix.

"The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man."
