# Playing with Arbitrary Style Transfer Deep Neural Network 


I am having fun with the work presented by **X. Huang, S. Belongie, "Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization", arXiv:1703.06868 (2017)**. 

The network provided here offered a quick transfer of style between figures. The trained network was imported from Mathematica 11.2 NetModel portion. 

Here is an interesting demo.
