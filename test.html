My name is &#205&#241;igo Qu&#237lez (don't worry, you can write 'Inigo Quilez', that's fine). I was born and grew up 
in <a class="regular" href="personal/donostia/donostia.htm">San Sebasti&#225;n (a.k.a. Donostia)</a>, a beautiful city in the <a class="regular" href="personal/aita/index.htm">Basque Country</a>, 
somewhere in Europe (Spain). I enjoy mathematics, writing, computer graphics, science, skiing (you can't beat me at this one), nature and weird stuff and adventures. I have a <a class="regular" href="personal/curri/curri.htm">resume</a>,
an e-mail address: <span style="color:#ffd080;">iquilezles@hotmail.com</span>, 
a <a class="regular" href="http://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq">Shadertoy</a> account, a <a class="regular" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mari1234mari">Youtube</a> channel,
a <a class="regular" href="https://www.facebook.com/inigo.quilez.art/">Facebook</a> page, a <a class="regular" href="https://twitter.com/iquilezles">Twitter</a> stream and
a after 18 years of writing here during my spare time, now that I'm starting to have less of it I have a <a class="regular" href="https://www.patreon.com/inigoquilez">Patreon</a> page where you can 
help me allocate actual time if you want so I can create more and better content for this page.<br>

<div class=" table">

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="prods/index.htm">productions</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell">this is where you have to go to look for finalized works like demos, videos and images. Most of them are motivated by the demoscene, meaning that they are programs you must download and run in your pc (like if it was a video game). You will also find video recordings of the pieces here when appropiate. All the material here is made by myself and my collaborators.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="www/index.htm">articles</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell">this is the place where I host articles, tutorials, explanations, code, and presentations related to maths, images, fractals, demoscene and computer graphics. If you are a fractal freak, a computer science nerd, or a math geek, or simply a demoscener, searching for some info, this is  what you are looking for.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="code/index.htm">code</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell">here I'm sharing the libraries and frameworks that I use for my C++ and JS demos, experiments, prototypes and products. I do update these very often, so use at your own risk.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="apps/index.htm">interactive</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell">this is the interactive part of this website where you can find a couple of computer graphics applications that you can experiment with. Hopefully this will grow bigger over time.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="live/index.htm">live</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell">when I don't have time for writing an article, i do some live coding instead, and put it here. Seeing a live coding session might not be the best way to learn, but it might be fun to you seeing some live hacking of formulanimations or mathimages?</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tableRow">
        <div class="tableCell"><a class="menu" href="blog/">blog</a></div>
        <div class="tableCell"><i>el trastero</i> is not a blog on boring computer graphics news, but there are few computer made images. It's not a blog about my ideology, although I sketch (and intentionally only sketch) few deep thoughts. It's definitely not a blog where you should learn maths, but you will find some formulas and constructions. It's not a blog about the latest news, but you will find some important secrets about the world. It's a blog of mine, but you will for sure not get to know me by reading it.</div>
